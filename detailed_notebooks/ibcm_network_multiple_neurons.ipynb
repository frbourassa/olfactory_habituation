    "#### The alternating inputs case works just fine! \n",
    "It's really the continuous character of the fluctuations in my linear mixture model,  which are effectively gaussian around the mean vector, that creates a ring of fixed points around that mean vector. If the distribution was multi-modal, I'm pretty sure the model would only have discrete fixed points. "

    "# Remark on stability of the steady-state and oscillations\n",
    "When $\\tau_{\\Theta}$ is too close to $\\frac{1}{\\mu}$, the learning time scale, the stable fixed points become unstable via a Hopf bifurcation (Udeigwe, ..., Ermentrout 2017), and oscillations around those foci appear. If $\\tau_{\\Theta}$ is further increased, the limit cycle also disappears and the solutions just escape to infinity. This result is known for the alternating input case. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also see this with our gaussian process for the input. Try the following sequence of parameter values to witness the appearance of small oscillations, then large oscillations, and finally instability. \n",
    "``` \n",
    "averages_nu = np.ones(n_components)\n",
    "learnrate = 0.0025; \n",
    "tau_avg = 100, 120, 150, 200  # 100 is stable, 120 small oscillations, 150 large, 200 unstable\n",
    "```\n",
    "The position of the bifurcations as a function of $\\tau_{\\Theta}$ also depends on the magnitude of the input fluctuations. A larger $\\tau_{\\Theta}$ value can still lead to non-oscillatory solutions if the input fluctuations are smaller, controlled by e.g. setting `averages_nu = np.ones(n_components) / np.sqrt(n_components)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "I did not explore this phenomenon much more for the moment; the lesson is that if oscillations or divergences appear in the simulations, they can be fixed by decreasing the learning rate (which makes the model convergence slower, though) or decreasing $\\tau_{\\Theta}$ (which increases the noise around the steady-state, though). Hopefully, that will never become too problematic -- although, note that we are already in a regime where the model is super slow compared to background fluctuations, which is worrying me about the realism of that model. But I don't think any model could do better without sampling the background statistics enough.  Also, note that by initializing the neurons closer to a proper inhibitory state, the convergence could be faster. It might also be faster in higher dimension, because many dimensions remain zero? Not sure. "

Will it be a first or second order phase transition? We will see. \n",
