HDF file structure
    .attrs: descriptive metadata
        "model" (str): IBCM, PCA, or AVG
        "background" (str): type of background, choice of "turbulent",
                "log-normal", "third_moment",  "gaussian", "alternating"
        "main_seed" (int): 128-bit integer main seed

    parameters (group): parameters that are the same for all runs
        .attrs: model options, passed as kwargs to the integration function
        dimensions (dataset of 4 ints): [n_r, n_b, n_i, n_k]
            n_i = number of inhibitory neurons
            n_k = number of Kenyon cells = size of neural tags
            This repeats some metadata from the attributes, but is useful.
        repeats (dataset of 6 ints): the number of repeats of each kind
            [n_runs, n_test_times, n_back_samples, n_new_odors,
            n_new_concs, skp]
        m_rates (dataset of 0-5 floats): M model rates,
            e.g. learnrate, tavg, coupling, sat, ktheta for Law-IBCM.
            Nothing here for average subtraction as M weights are not used.
        w_rates (dataset of 2 floats): W weights rates, i.e., [alpha, beta]
        time_params (dataset of 2 floats): tmax (final t), dt (time step=1.0)
        back_params (dataset of floats): parameters of the stochastic process
            for the background concentrations. For turbulent backgrounds,
            this is a 6 x n_b array; axis 0 indices are for parameters
                whiff_tmin, whiff_tmax, blank_tmin, blank_tmax, c0, alpha
        snap_times (dataset): times at which habituation is tested, in steps
        new_concs (dataset): concentrations at which new odors are introduced
            typically 0.5 and 1.0 times the average.
        moments_conc (dataset): average, variance, and central third moment
            of the background odor concentrations.

    odors (group): background and new odors
        back_odors (dataset of floats): background odors for each simulations,
            shape [n_runs, n_b, n_r]
        new_odors (dataset of floats): new odors tested in all simulations at
            each test time, shape [n_new_odors, n_r]

    proj_kwargs (group): with datasets for kc_sparsity=0.05,
                adapt_kc=True, n_pn_per_kc=3, project_thresh_fact=0.1

    sim0000 (group): one group per simulation, with all initial conditions
    and results from that simulation. 0000 is replaced by the simulation id,
    counting from 0. For instance, sim. #37 has results in group "sim0037".
        .attrs: attributes of this run
            id (int): simulation number, also present in the name of the group
            spawn_key (int): spawn key of the SeedSequence of this simulation
                The rng within this simulation is thus initialized with
                SeedSequence(entropy=main_seed, spawn_key=[spawn_key,])
        m_init (dataset): shape [n_i, n_r]: initial m weights.
            None for average background subtraction.
        l_init (dataset): initial coupling weights, only relevant for PCA
            because for IBCM this entire matrix is based on the eta param.
        bk_init (group):
            bk_vari_init (dataset): initial value of background stochastic
                variables, shape [n_b, n_var_per_odor]
            bk_vec_init (dataset): initial background vector, shape [n_orn]
        back_conc_snaps (dataset): snapshot of background concentration
            series at snap times, shape [n_test_times, n_b, n_var_per_odor]
        back_vec_snaps (dataset): snapshots of background vector at snap_times,
            shape [n_test_times, n_b]
        extra_test_backs (dataset): extra background vectors tested at each
            snap time against each new odor, new for each time;
            shape [n_test_times, n_back_samples-1, n_r].
            Not recording individual background concentrations, these can be
            recovered knowing these test background vectors are linear combi-
            nations of the unique set of background components of that run.
        m_snaps (dataset): snapshots of M weights at snap_times, if applicable,
            shape [n_test_times, n_i, n_r]

        hbar_snaps (dataset): snapshots of inhibitory neurons' coupled
            activities, cbars, at snap_times; shape [n_test_times, n_i]

            thresholds, $\bar{\Theta}$, shape [n_test_times, n_i]
        w_snaps (dataset): snapshots of inhibitory weights at test times,
            shape [n_test_times, n_r, n_i]
        y_snaps (dataset): snapshots of PN neuron activities at test times,
            in presence of the simulated background (no new odors, no extra
            test background concentrations); shape [n_test_times, n_r].

            matrix from PNs to KCs used to generate neural tags
