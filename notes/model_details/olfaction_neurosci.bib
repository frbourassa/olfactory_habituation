	abstract = {We showed previously (Gorur-Shandilya et al., 2017) that Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) expressing the co-receptor Orco scale their gain inversely with mean odor intensity according to Weber-Fechner’s law. Here, we show that this front-end adaptation promotes the reconstruction of odor identity from dynamic odor signals, even in the presence of confounding background odors and rapid intensity fluctuations. These enhancements are further aided by known downstream transformations in the antennal lobe and mushroom body. Our results, which are applicable to various odor classification and reconstruction schemes, stem from the fact that this adaptation mechanism is not intrinsic to the identity of the receptor involved. Instead, a feedback mechanism adjusts receptor sensitivity based on the activity of the receptor-Orco complex, according to Weber-Fechner’s law. Thus, a common scaling of the gain across Orco-expressing ORNs may be a key feature of ORN adaptation that helps preserve combinatorial odor codes in naturalistic landscapes.},

	abstract = {Odor landscapes contain complex blends of molecules that each activate unique, overlapping populations of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Despite the presence of hundreds of OSN subtypes in many animals, the overlapping nature of odor inputs may lead to saturation of neural responses at the early stages of stimulus encoding. Information loss due to saturation could be mitigated by normalizing mechanisms such as antagonism at the level of receptor-ligand interactions, whose existence and prevalence remains uncertain. By imaging OSN axon terminals in olfactory bulb glomeruli as well as OSN cell bodies within the olfactory epithelium in freely breathing mice, we find widespread antagonistic interactions in binary odor mixtures. In complex mixtures of up to 12 odorants, antagonistic interactions are stronger and more prevalent with increasing mixture complexity. Therefore, antagonism is a common feature of odor mixture encoding in OSNs and helps in normalizing activity to reduce saturation and increase information transfer.},

	abstract = {Natural environments feature mixtures of odorants of diverse quantities, qualities and complexities. Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) are the first layer in the sensory pathway and transmit the olfactory signal to higher regions of the brain. Yet, the response of ORNs to mixtures is strongly non-additive, and exhibits antagonistic interactions among odorants. Here, we model the processing of mixtures by mammalian ORNs, focusing on the role of inhibitory mechanisms. We show how antagonism leads to an effective ‘normalization’ of the ensemble ORN response, that is, the distribution of responses of the ORN population induced by any mixture is largely independent of the number of components in the mixture. This property arises from a novel mechanism involving the distinct statistical properties of receptor binding and activation, without any recurrent neuronal circuitry. Normalization allows our encoding model to outperform non-interacting models in odor discrimination tasks, leads to experimentally testable predictions and explains several psychophysical experiments in humans.},

	abstract = {Identifying relevant information embedded within a constant and noisy background is a challenge faced by many sensory systems in the brain. Habituation—the reduction in responsiveness to repeated, neutral stimuli—is an unsupervised learning method the brain uses to overcome this challenge. Here, we propose a neural algorithm for odor habituation based on the olfactory circuit in fruit flies. We demonstrate how habituation enhances discrimination between similar odors and improves foreground detection by subtracting background noise. More broadly, this perspective helps bridge the gap between sensory neurobiology and cognition.Habituation is a form of simple memory that suppresses neural activity in response to repeated, neutral stimuli. This process is critical in helping organisms guide attention toward the most salient and novel features in the environment. Here, we follow known circuit mechanisms in the fruit fly olfactory system to derive a simple algorithm for habituation. We show, both empirically and analytically, that this algorithm is able to filter out redundant information, enhance discrimination between odors that share a similar background, and improve detection of novel components in odor mixtures. Overall, we propose an algorithmic perspective on the biological mechanism of habituation and use this perspective to understand how sensory physiology can affect odor perception. Our framework may also help toward understanding the effects of habituation in other more sophisticated neural systems.},

In Exp I, Ss were required to select the 4 dissimilar odorants, each characterized by a dominant quality and described by a commonly used word (e.g., cloves). Exp II investigated how Ss' perceptions of the intensity and odor quality of binary mixtures of the odorants changed as the concentration of the components was varied. Five concentrations of each of the 2 odorants in 6 odor pairs were used. Results indicate that consistent data were obtained from each of the odor pairs and that the intensity of odorants, not their quality, determined the contribution of each to the quality of a mixture. Findings confirm the observations that the odor quality of binary mixtures is most similar to the strongest (unmixed) component and that both components are perceived when a mixture contains approximately equal (unmixed) intensity components.

Although recent studies have revealed how olfactory sensory input is  conveyed to each glomerulus, it still remains unclear how the information is  integrated and conveyed to other brain areas. By using the GAL4 enhancer-trap  system, we conducted a systematic mapping of the neurons associated with the primary  olfactory center of Drosophila, the antennal lobe (AL). We identified in total 29  types of neurons, among which 13 are newly identified in the present study.

Similar to other sensory modalities, increased odor backgrounds decrease the detectability of target odors by the olfactory system. The mechanisms by which background odors interfere with the detection and identification of target odors are unknown. Here we utilized the framework of the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) to consider possible interference mechanisms in an odor detection task. We consider effects of background odors on both signal and noise in the decision-making dynamics, and show that these produce different predictions about decision accuracy and speed. To test these predictions, we trained mice to detect target odors that are embedded in random background mixtures in a two-alternative choice task. We found that the behavioral data is most consistent with background odors acting by adding noise to the decision-making dynamics. The added noise decreases the correct rate, but also decreases decision times, thereby creating a paradoxical relationship between speed and accuracy of target detection, where mice make faster and less accurate decisions in the presence of background odors.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

            The convergent evolution of the fly and mouse olfactory system led us to ask whether the anatomic connectivity and functional logic
            in vivo
            would evolve in artificial neural networks constructed to perform olfactory tasks. Artificial networks trained to classify odor identity recapitulate the connectivity inherent in the olfactory system. Input units are driven by a single receptor type, and units driven by the same receptor converge to form a glomerulus. Glomeruli exhibit sparse, unstructured connectivity to a larger, expansion layer. When trained to both classify odor and impart innate valence on odors, the network develops independent pathways for innate output and odor classification. Thus, artificial networks evolve even without the biological mechanisms necessary to build these systems
            in vivo
            , providing a rationale for the convergent evolution of olfactory circuits.},

	abstract = {Patients with COVID-19 can develop loss of smell and/or taste. Unfortunately, the pathophysiology of these alterations remains unclear. Here, de Melo et al. examined the olfactory mucosa in patients with COVID-19 reporting loss of smell and detected SARS-CoV-2 viral particles and inflammation in multiple cell types in the olfactory neuroepithelium, including olfactory sensory neurons. Hamster infected with SARS-CoV-2 developed loss of smell that was associated with dissemination of the virus in the olfactory mucosa and CNS and with neuroinflammation. In four patients who developed persistent loss of smell, the authors detected lasting SARS-CoV-2 presence in the olfactory mucosa, suggesting that the prolonged relapsing anosmia in patients with COVID-19 could be due to persistent viral infection.Whereas recent investigations have revealed viral, inflammatory, and vascular factors involved in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lung pathogenesis, the pathophysiology of neurological disorders in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains poorly understood. Olfactory and taste dysfunction are common in COVID-19, especially in mildly symptomatic patients. Here, we conducted a virologic, molecular, and cellular study of the olfactory neuroepithelium of seven patients with COVID-19 presenting with acute loss of smell. We report evidence that the olfactory neuroepithelium is a major site of SARS-CoV2 infection with multiple cell types, including olfactory sensory neurons, support cells, and immune cells, becoming infected. SARS-CoV-2 replication in the olfactory neuroepithelium was associated with local inflammation. Furthermore, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 induced acute anosmia and ageusia in golden Syrian hamsters, lasting as long as the virus remained in the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb. Last, olfactory mucosa sampling from patients showing long-term persistence of COVID-19–associated anosmia revealed the presence of virus transcripts and of SARS-CoV-2–infected cells, together with protracted inflammation. SARS-CoV-2 persistence and associated inflammation in the olfactory neuroepithelium may account for prolonged or relapsing symptoms of COVID-19, such as loss of smell, which should be considered for optimal medical management of this disease.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1106411108},
	abstract = {Despite its ubiquity and significance, behavioral habituation is poorly understood in terms of the underlying neural circuit mechanisms. Here, we present evidence that habituation arises from potentiation of inhibitory transmission within a circuit motif commonly repeated in the nervous system. In Drosophila, prior odorant exposure results in a selective reduction of response to this odorant. Both short-term (STH) and long-term (LTH) forms of olfactory habituation require function of the rutabaga-encoded adenylate cyclase in multiglomerular local interneurons (LNs) that mediate GABAergic inhibition in the antennal lobe; LTH additionally requires function of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB2) transcription factor in LNs. The odorant selectivity of STH and LTH is mirrored by requirement for NMDA receptors and GABAA receptors in odorant-selective, glomerulus-specific projection neurons(PNs). The need for the vesicular glutamate transporter in LNs indicates that a subset of these GABAergic neurons also releases glutamate. LTH is associated with a reduction of odorant-evoked calcium fluxes in PNs as well as growth of the respective odorant-responsive glomeruli. These cellular changes use similar mechanisms to those required for behavioral habituation. Taken together with the observation that enhancement of GABAergic transmission is sufficient to attenuate olfactory behavior, these data indicate that habituation arises from glomerulus-selective potentiation of inhibitory synapses in the antennal lobe. We suggest that similar circuit mechanisms may operate in other species and sensory systems.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we design a fast background subtraction algorithm and deploy this algorithm on a monitoring system based on NAO humanoid robot. The proposed algorithm detects a contiguous foreground via a contiguously weighted linear regression (CWLR) model. It consists of a background model and a foreground model. The background model is a regression based low rank model. It seeks a low rank background subspace and represents the background as the linear combination of the basis spanning the subspace. The foreground model promotes the contiguity in the foreground detection. It encourages the foreground to be detected as whole regions rather than separated pixels. We formulate the background and foreground model into a contiguously weighted linear regression problem. This problem can be solved efficiently via an alternating optimization approach which includes continuous and discrete variables. Given an image sequence, we use the first few frames to incrementally initialize the background subspace, and we determine the background and foreground in the following frames in an online scheme using the proposed CWLR model, with the background subspace continuously updated using the detected background information. The proposed algorithm is implemented by Python on a NAO humanoid robot based monitoring system. This system consists of a control station and a Nao robot. The Nao robot acts as a mobile probe. It captures image sequence and sends it to the control station. The control station serves as a control terminal. It sends commands to control the behavior of Nao robot, and it processes the image data sent by Nao. This system can be used for living environment monitoring and form the basis for many vision-based applications like fall detection and scene understanding. The experimental comparisons with most recent algorithms on both benchmark dataset and NAO captures demonstrate the high effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Sensory systems are often tasked to analyse complex signals from the environment, to separate relevant from irrelevant parts. This process of decomposing signals is challenging when component signals interfere with each other. For example, when a mixture of signals does not equal the sum of its parts, this leads to an unpredictable corruption of signal patterns, making the target recognition harder. In olfaction, nonlinear summation is prevalent at various stages of sensory processing, from stimulus transduction in the nasal epithelium to higher areas, including the olfactory bulb (OB) and the piriform cortex. Here, we investigate how the olfactory system deals with binary mixtures of odours, using two-photon imaging with several behavioural paradigms. Unlike previous studies using anaesthetised animals, we found the mixture summation to be substantially more linear when using awake, head-fixed mice performing an odour detection task. This linearisation was also observed in awake, untrained mice, in both engaged and disengaged states, revealing that the bulk of the difference in mixture summation is explained by the brain state. However, in the apical dendrites of M/T cells, mixture representation is dominated by sublinear summation. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the property of mixture representation in the primary olfactory area likely reflects state-dependent differences in sensory processing.},

	abstract = {Synaptic inhibition critically influences sensory processing throughout the mammalian brain, including the main olfactory bulb (MOB), the first station of sensory processing in the olfactory system. Decades of research across numerous laboratories have established a central role for granule cells (GCs), the most abundant GABAergic interneuron type in the MOB, in the precise regulation of principal mitral and tufted cell (M/TC) firing rates and synchrony through lateral and recurrent inhibitory mechanisms. In addition to GCs, however, the MOB contains a vast diversity of other GABAergic interneuron types, and recent findings suggest that, while fewer in number, these oft-ignored interneurons are just as important as GCs in shaping odor-evoked M/TC activity. Here I challenge the prevailing centrality of GCs. In this review, I first outline the specific properties of each GABAergic interneuron type in the rodent MOB, with particular emphasis placed on direct interneuron recordings and cell type-selective manipulations. On the basis of these properties, I then critically reevaluate the contribution of GCs vs. other interneuron types to the regulation of odor-evoked M/TC firing rates and synchrony via lateral, recurrent, and other inhibitory mechanisms. This analysis yields a novel model in which multiple interneuron types with distinct abundances, connectivity patterns, and physiologies complement one another to regulate M/TC activity and sensory processing.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06966},
	abstract = {Artificial neural networks that learn to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and related tasks using strictly local learning rules have been previously derived based on the principle of similarity matching: similar pairs of inputs should map to similar pairs of outputs. However, the operation of these networks (and of similar networks) requires a fixed-point iteration to determine the output corresponding to a given input, which means that dynamics must operate on a faster time scale than the variation of the input. Further, during these fast dynamics such networks typically "disable" learning, updating synaptic weights only once the fixed-point iteration has been resolved. Here, we derive a network for PCA-based dimensionality reduction that avoids this fast fixed-point iteration. The key novelty of our approach is a modification of the similarity matching objective to encourage near-diagonality of a synaptic weight matrix. We then approximately invert this matrix using a Taylor series approximation, replacing the previous fast iterations. In the offline setting, our algorithm corresponds to a dynamical system, the stability of which we rigorously analyze. In the online setting (i.e., with stochastic gradients), we map our algorithm to a familiar neural network architecture and give numerical results showing that our method converges at a competitive rate. The computational complexity per iteration of our online algorithm is linear in the total degrees of freedom, which is in some sense optimal.},

	abstract = {Fluid turbulence is a double-edged sword for the navigation of macroscopic animals, such as birds, insects, and rodents. On the one hand, turbulence enables pheromone communication among mates and the possibility of locating food by their odors from long distances. Molecular diffusion would indeed be unable to spread odors over relevant distances in natural conditions. On the other hand, turbulent flows are hard to predict, and learning effective maneuvers to navigate them is challenging, as we discuss in this review. We first provide a summary of the olfactory organs that sense airborne or surface-bound odors, as well as the computational tasks that animals face when extracting information useful for navigation from an olfactory signal. A compendium of the dynamics of turbulent transport emphasizes those aspects that directly impact animals? behavior. The state of the art on navigational strategies is discussed, followed by a concluding section dedicated to future challenges in the field.},

	abstract = {A fundamental problem in neural network research, as well as in many other disciplines, is finding a suitable representation of multivariate data, i.e. random vectors. For reasons of computational and conceptual simplicity, the representation is often sought as a linear transformation of the original data. In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation. In this paper, we present the basic theory and applications of ICA, and our recent work on the subject.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12632},
	abstract = {An important problem in neuroscience is to understand how brains extract relevant signals from mixtures of unknown sources, i.e., perform blind source separation. To model how the brain performs this task, we seek a biologically plausible single-layer neural network implementation of a blind source separation algorithm. For biological plausibility, we require the network to satisfy the following three basic properties of neuronal circuits: (i) the network operates in the online setting; (ii) synaptic learning rules are local; (iii) neuronal outputs are nonnegative. Closest is the work by Pehlevan et al. [Neural Computation, 29, 2925--2954 (2017)], which considers Nonnegative Independent Component Analysis (NICA), a special case of blind source separation that assumes the mixture is a linear combination of uncorrelated, nonnegative sources. They derive an algorithm with a biologically plausible 2-layer network implementation. In this work, we improve upon their result by deriving 2 algorithms for NICA, each with a biologically plausible single-layer network implementation. The first algorithm maps onto a network with indirect lateral connections mediated by interneurons. The second algorithm maps onto a network with direct lateral connections and multi-compartmental output neurons.},

Here, we address a special case of this problem when sources (but not the mixing matrix) are known to be nonnegative—for example, due to the physical nature of the sources. We search for the solution to this problem that can be implemented using biologically plausible neural networks. Specifically, we consider the online setting where the data set is streamed to a neural network. The novelty of our approach is that we formulate blind nonnegative source separation as a similarity matching problem and derive neural networks from the similarity matching objective.

Here, we introduce a computationally efficient version of similarity matching, a framework for online dimensionality reduction that incrementally estimates the top K-dimensional principal subspace of streamed data while keeping in memory only the last sample and the current iterate. To assess the performance of our approach, we construct and make public a test suite containing both a synthetic data generator and the infrastructure to test online dimensionality reduction algorithms on real datasets, as well as performant implementations of our algorithm and competing algorithms with similar aims. Among the algorithms considered we find our approach to be competitive, performing among the best on both synthetic and real data.},
