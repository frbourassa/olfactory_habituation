%To be done. 
% Exponentially-generated odors or even database
% Fluctuation distribution from Celani 2014
	% Steady-state distributions of concentration of whiffs, whiffs or blanks durations
	% Numerical simulation of those distributions
	% Telegraph-like process simulation rule
	% Stick to independent sources. 
% Ultimate goal

% Compare the various methods: average subtraction, IBCM, PCA, ICA. Hopefully, IBCM comes out on top; if not, change the focus of the paper. In any case, if some method works well, we're done!

%As necessary. 
	% Will likely need 1) saturation of inputs, 2)
	% Will likely be numerical only
	% Will likely need Cython/C/C++/julia code to be run often enough
	% Will be necessary if the model keeps failing to deliver very good recognition of  new odors in mixtures of 80% background - 20 % new odor. 
	% Need to make the IBCM model with tanh activation functions work... Or maybe not if the inputs are tanh-ed instead. 
	% Learning threshold on saturating tanh functions
	% Another way to see this: the inhibitory neurons learn a weighted average of what IBCM neurons respond to. Need a way to normalize this weighting, otherwise can diverge if fluctuations too large/signal magnitude too large.
